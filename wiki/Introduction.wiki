#summary An introduction to Leaf

= Introduction =

Leaf is a framework/tool written in C for conducting security research on closed (or open) source Elf objects. I plan to support Linux, BSD and Solaris platforms. Currently Linux has the most complete support, including a debug API.

= Some Details =

Leaf contains:
  * Elf parsing and analysis code
  * An x86/x86-64 disassembler (64 bit support is disabled at the moment)
  * A plugin interface (with example plugins)
